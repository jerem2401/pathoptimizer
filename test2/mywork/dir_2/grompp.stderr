Ignoring obsolete mdp entry 'ns_type'

WARNING 1 [file md.mdp]:
  You are generating velocities so I am assuming you are equilibrating a
  system. You are using Parrinello-Rahman pressure coupling, but this can
  be unstable for equilibration. If your system crashes, try equilibrating
  first with Berendsen pressure coupling. If you are not equilibrating the
  system, you can probably ignore this warning.

NOTE 1 [file polcc_ZN_heavyH.top, line 851113]:
  In moleculetype 'Protein_chain_A' 11 atoms are not bound by a potential
  or constraint to any other atom in the same moleculetype. Although
  technically this might not cause issues in a simulation, this often means
  that the user forgot to add a bond/potential/constraint or put multiple
  molecules in the same moleculetype definition by mistake. Run with -v to
  get information for each atom.


NOTE 2 [file polcc_ZN_heavyH.top, line 851113]:
  The bond in molecule-type Protein_chain_A between atoms 86500 C6 and
  86502 C5 has an estimated oscillational period of 2.1e-02 ps, which is
  less than 10 times the time step of 4.0e-03 ps.
  Maybe you forgot to change the constraints mdp option.

Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group ZN_MG_DNA_Protein is 226566.61
Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group SOL_CL_NA is 1484508.38

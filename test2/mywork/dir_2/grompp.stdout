Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.005 kJ/mol/ps at 300 K
Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 1.087 nm, buffer size 0.087 nm
Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 1.020 nm, buffer size 0.020 nm
Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup
Calculating fourier grid dimensions for X Y Z
Using a fourier grid of 144x144x144, spacing 0.158 0.158 0.158
This run will generate roughly 64 Mb of data
